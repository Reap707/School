Project Summary
This  is a C++ program that reads grocery items from a text file and tracks how often each item appears. It helps users quickly find, display, and visualize item frequencies, while also backing up the data to frequency.dat.
What I Did Well
•	Created ItemIndex class to handle logic separately from the UI.
•	input validation to validate using toUpper() on the first character.
•	Built a clean, user-friendly interface.
•	Wrote detailed  inline comments explaining what each important line of code does.
•	
Areas for Improvement
•	Case Insensitivity: This program only validates the first letter of the user input where it should validate the  full string to search accuracy.
•	File Error Handling: Adding checks for missing or corrupt files would make the program more reliable.
Result: These improvements would boost efficiency, security, and overall polish.

Tools and Skills Gained
•	Efficient data mapping with std::map
•	Research and implemented industry standard validation techniques.
•	Working with i/o streams to read and write to files.
•	Professional-level commenting and clean coding practices
Transferable Skills
The implementation of Industry standards for naming, commenting and planning for projects.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
•	Logic separated into ItemIndex.cpp; UI in main.cpp
•	Consistent formatting and naming for future scalability
